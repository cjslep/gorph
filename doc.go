/*
Package gorph manipulates graphic images in order to procedurally modify or create derived images. The
datastructures and algorithms provided allow client codes to pre-render or procedurally generate new
images from base images.

This library is designed to use the standard libraries as much as possible in order to leverage the
"image" and "image/color" libraries heavily.
